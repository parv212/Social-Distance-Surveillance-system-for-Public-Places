# Social-Distance-Surveillance-system-for-Public-Places
This project was developed by me and my hackathon teammates in which we first identified the persons by using the mRCNN algorithm to accurately detect person's in the video and then calculate the distance from the centroid of the person's bounding box using the cdist function of the scipy library. After calculating the distance we compare it with the threshold and calculate the total number of violations happening at a specific point of time.
