# Social-Distance-Surveillance-system-for-Public-Places

This GitHub repository presents the development of an AI-powered social distancing surveillance system, designed to monitor and ensure adherence to social distancing guidelines in public and office spaces. The project utilizes the state-of-the-art Mask RCNN pre-trained COCO model for object detection in video frames, focusing particularly on detecting people and assessing their compliance with social distancing.

Key aspects of the project include:

* **Problem Statement:** Addressing the challenge of monitoring social distancing in public and office spaces during the ongoing pandemic.
* **Methodology:** Utilizing Mask RCNN for object detection, extracting human figures from video frames, and calculating the Euclidean distance between individuals to detect social distancing violations.
* **Experimental Results:** Implementation of the system, highlighting its capability to detect distancing violations in real-time, with a focus on improving accuracy and handling various challenges.
* **Future Development:** Plans to enhance the system with features like dynamic distance calculation, bird-eye view implementation, and notification alerts for social distancing violationsâ€‹
